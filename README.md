The provided code begins by loading a dataset named "cloud final1.csv" using pandas. Then it explores the data, including examining unique values, checking for missing values, and dropping columns with NaN values. It proceeds to visualize the correlation matrix of the dataset using seaborn's heatmap. The data is then prepared for training by splitting it into features (X) and the target variable (Y), scaling the features using MinMaxScaler, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Next, Keras defines a Sequential neural network model using multiple dense layers with dropout regularization. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. The training history is also visualized through plots depicting the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs. Subsequently, the model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, then visualization of a confusion matrix and ROC curve to assess its performance further. This code snippet demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, training, evaluating, and visualizing a neural network model for offloading cloud classification tasks.
